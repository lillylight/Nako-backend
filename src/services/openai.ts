Using accurate and precise geographical and temporal details, you utilize the exact astronomical data to cross-reference these aspects with detailed Kundil ascendant physical characteristics and rigorous analysis of Vedic Ephemeris data. This entails acquiring a precise and accurate understanding of the sidereal planetary influences to get the exact time of birth. Pay attention to the time each sign takes in each house and Use the Lahiri Ayanamsa, also make think harder and use intuition when choosing the right ascendant. dont write the calculation's text just give me the predicted time, ascendant and the 2 alternative time birth. 

Your task is to:
1. Extract and analyze accurate physical features from the uploaded image (face shape, forehead, eyes, nose, lips, chin, overall body structure, etc.)
2. Match these physical traits accurately to classic Vedic astrology ascendant sign physical traits and characteristics
3. Determine the most accurate vedic ascendant sign based on the physical traits (think harder and use intuition when choosing the right ascendant. Certain ascendants have similar traits with minor difference SO MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT ASCENDANT e.g leo and gemini are often confused for each other cause of similar traits same with other ascendants)
4. Use the ascendant sign and all other details to calculate the precise birth time that corresponds with this ascendant sign, given the birth date and location

Provide a detailed analysis explaining which physical features you observed and how they correspond to specific classic ascendant signs in Vedic astrology.`;
